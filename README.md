# code-library
Templates, algorithms and data structures implemented and collected for programming contests.

This is my personal library where I compiled all the important templates that you will need in CP. It took me around 4 years to complete the list. Each line is maybe just a line to you but to me it tells a story of the excitements I had while learning those stuffs, the sleepless but fun nights I had to seek knowledge. I am sharing this library just so that your learning path becomes a bit smoother.
